# 1. Business Understanding

**Objective**

The main business goal is to analyze customer sentiments expressed as tweets about various brands or products. By building a sentiment classification model, the company aims to:

Measure public opinion of its products or services.

Identify negative feedback early to improve on customer experience.

Track brand reputation and customer satisfaction over time.

Support marketing and product strategy decisions based on data-driven insights.

In this project, we are aiming to build a machine learning model that can determine the sentiment of a tweet based on the content, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.This is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem, useful for applications such as social media monitoring, brand-analysis, and customer-feedback tracking.

# Key Business Questions

What proportion of customer mentions express positive vs. negative emotions?

How can the business improve customer satisfaction based on sentiment trends?

# Success Criteria

Achieve a classification accuracy of at least 67% (baseline observed: 0.6707).
